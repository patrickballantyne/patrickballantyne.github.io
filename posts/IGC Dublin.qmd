### 35th International Geographical Congress 2024

*I have just returned from a week at the International Geographical Congress in Dublin, Ireland. The conference, which happens every four years, brings together a really diverse group of geographers from across the world to discuss current and emerging research from a variety of the sub-disciplines of geography. I had a great week, and below I document some of my thoughts.*

### Applied Geography: Applied Smart Data Research

I presented some of my recent work in a session put together by the Applied Geography Commission, chaired by Nik Lomax from the University of Leeds. The paper I presented was a summary of our recent [Heseltine Institute Policy Brief](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/publicpolicyamppractice/pbseries3/PB315.pdf) around the Economic Impact of Eurovision in Liverpool. My talk focused on showing the power of smart datasets such as Mastercard Geo Insights, and we had a lively discussion around the challenges of working with these data. This talk also gave me the opportunity to reflect on how I can generate an academic paper from the exploratory analysis conducted thus far. 

Slides from my talk are available to view [here](IGC-Slides-PB.pdf).

Aside from my presentation, I enjoyed meeting (and reconnecting) with lots of cool people, and listening to lots of really nice talks! I particularly enjoyed spending time in Dublin, which despite spending a large amount of time in Ireland each year, I rarely get to do - of course I had to see if I could find my favourite pint of guinness too! :)
