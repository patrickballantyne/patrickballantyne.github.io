### "Geographic Data Science for Urban Analytics"

*A five day short course on the use of new forms of data to study cities, grounding students in the basic principles of Geographic Data Science.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the 5th - 9th September, Prof. Alex Singleton and I visited Prof. Keiji Yano and his students at Ritsumeikan University, to deliver a five-day short course on Geographic Data Science for Urban Analytics.

The course, co-taught by both of us, consisted of morning lectures on topics such as **city structure and function**, **new forms of data and the analysis of cities** and **geographic data science for urban analytics**, followed by afternoon practicals taught in R which built from **basic R programming** to **mapping areas and context** and **visualizing point patterns**.

We finished the week with a series of student presentations on a short group project that they had each carried out, where we awarded prizes to the excellent students.

We had a fantastic week, and it was my first trip to Japan so managed to get lots of exploring done!
