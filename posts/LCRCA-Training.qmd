### Introduction to R for Policy

*In May, I co-delivered a four-day workshop to policy analysts at Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. This workshop, co-delivered with Prof. Francisco Rowe, aimed to provide a gentle introduction to R, before building progressively to cover more advanced topics such as dashboard construction, APIs and time-series modelling*.

Earlier in the year I was approached by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) policy analyst team to design and deliver a bespoke training course, which could provide their team with the skills needed to use R in their daily workflows. The class comprised a mixture of people very familiar with programming languages as well as those who had never programmed before. Together with Prof. Rowe, I delivered four days of content covering the following topics:

1.  R Fundamentals
2.  Data Visualisation
3.  Dashboards and APIs
4.  Data Modelling (Time-Series)

It was a great opportunity for me to design a new course from scratch, and work collaboratively with a senior colleague to think about how best to teach this course to such a diverse range of abilities. Below I provide a sample of some of the outputs from this work, however we are unfortunately able to share these materials as they are owned by LCRCA.
