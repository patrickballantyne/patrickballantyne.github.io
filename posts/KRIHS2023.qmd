### Research Visit to South Korea

*I recently co-ordinated the return visit to South Korea as a follow up to our earlier exchange with visitors from [KRIHS last Autumn](https://patrickballantyne.github.io/posts/KRIHS2022.html). Ten members of the GDSL headed to South Korea for 9 day visit, comprising research exchanges with KRIHS and other Korean academics in Sejong and at the University of Seoul, a visit to the Eco Delta Smart City project in Busan, and plenty of sightseeing.*

### Lessons Learned

As part of the original grant, money had been allocated to facilitate a return exchange where GDSL researchers would visit KRIHS in Korea for a series of knowledge expansion and exchange workshops. Part of my role as the postdoc to the PI on the grant was organising and co-coordinating this exchange, involving activities such as:

-   Booking flights and travel for everyone
-   Organising accommodation
-   Getting visas in place
-   Managing the grant budget, allocating daily expenses
-   Scheduling keynote and lightning talks from GDSL representatives
-   Preparing and delivering a presentation showcasing my own research
-   Being the key point of contact during our visit to Korea for KRIHS and other representatives

This was a great learning experience for me, giving me first hand experience of how to effectively manage and spend grant money, and co-ordinate a large international exchange between Liverpool and institutes in Korea.
