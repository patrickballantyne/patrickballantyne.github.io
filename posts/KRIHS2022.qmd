### "Supporting Post Pandemic Recovery and Resilience Through New Forms of Data"

*A knowledge exchange from researchers from the Geographic Data Science Lab (GDSL) and the Korean Research Institute for Human Settlements (KRIHS).*

---

From the 7th - 10th November, Prof. Alex Singleton and I hosted researchers from KRIHS for a four day research exchange at Liverpool Science Park. The research exchange aimed to improve our understanding of how we can use new forms of data to understand how cities in the UK and Korea are recovering from the pandemic. 

The week was jam packed with activities, featuring keynote talks from Prof. Iain Buchan (University of Liverpool), Dr. Eunsum Im (KRIHS) and Prof. Ed Manley (University of Leeds), a series of "Let the Data Speak" presentations from GDSL postdoctoral researchers, 20 lightning talks from staff and students at KRIHS and the GDSL and a tour of the Digital Innovation Facility.
