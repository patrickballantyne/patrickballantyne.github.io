## Who Am I?

Patrick is a **Geographic Information Scientist** who seeks to generate new and important insights about cities and regions, with a particular emphasis on processes and dynamics related to:

**Retailing, Retail Spaces & Consumer Behaviour**

**Transport Geography, Infrastructure Planning & 15-Minute Cities**

**Spatial Inequality, Place-Based Policy and Digital Planning**

His research harnesses cutting-edge methodologies, various forms of spatial and non-spatial data, and partnerships with public and private sector organisations to answer interesting and impactful research questions. He is particularly passionate about developing accessible research outputs and tools, which when underpinned by sophisticated data and models can be used to support effective decision-making in policy settings.
