## Hobbies and Interests

### Running 

I am a big fan of running, and can often be found panting and sweating my way around Sefton Park or along the Promenade at the weekends. 

During lockdown, I completed the 'Couch to 5k' challenge and got completely hooked on running. Last summer I took part in my first half marathon race in Chester, and one day hope to complete a full marathon.

### Foodie

I love to eat out and go out for drinks with my friends, with a particular obsession over tacos, ramen, craft beer, coffee and donuts. 

Some of my favourite places in Liverpool include Koffi, The Pen Factory, The Grapes, Free State Kitchen and Mother Espresso.
