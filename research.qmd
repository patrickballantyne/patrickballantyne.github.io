### Retail and High Street Performance

I have a keen interest in understanding how the retail sector and physical spaces of consumption like retail centres are evolving. I'm particularly interested in how we can use innovative methodologies borrowed from Geographic Data Science and new forms of data to identify and measure such trends. Furthermore, I also have a wider interest in consumer behaviour, the drivers of consumer patronage and the impacts of external phenomena on sales and footfall for retailers. Currently I am supervising a PhD project on the use of loyalty card data from a major pet retailer to examine some of these issues.

### Urban Mobility and New Forms of Data

Following some research in my PhD which utilised mobility data, I have a keen interest in working closely with these types of data and using them to better understand processes of urban mobility. In particular, I am interested in asking questions such as *how is urban mobility changing?*, *what new questions/problems can we solve with data from mobile phone applications?*, *how representative are these sources of data?* and *to what extent can we use these datasets to model observed human behaviours, like store visitation?*.

### Accessibility and Social/Spatial Inequalities

Building on some of the work I am currently doing for Liverpool City Region, I have a keen interest in identifying and addressing social and spatial inequalities. In particular, I am interested in developing further how we conceptualise and measure inequality, and the use of new tools and datasets to support such insights. Over the next few months I plan to keep the momentum of such research going, as I develop new accessibility metrics for sustainable transport across Liverpool City Region.
