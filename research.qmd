## Research Themes

### 1) Retailing, Retail Spaces and Consumer Behaviour

Key themes I am exploring:

-   How can we characterise the geographies of retail centre agglomerations, particularly in terms of where they are located, what characteristics they have, and who uses them?
-   How is the composition and economic performance of retail centres and high streets changing?
-   In what ways is consumer behaviour changing, how can we measure this, and what are the social, economic and environmental consequences of these shifts?

### 2) Transport Geography, Infrastructure Planning and 15-Minute Cities

Key themes I am exploring:

- Development of small area measures of (sustainable) transport inequality, bringing together elements of supply & demand, to explore where better investment might lead to increased mode shift away from private cars. 
- How can we design empirical evidence to steer decision making around new sustainable transport infrastructure, and new pedestrian infrastructure. 
- In what ways is the "15-Minute City" concept a useful framwork to reduce transport (and retail) inequalities across cities?


### 3) Spatial Inequality, Place-Based Policy and Digital Planning 

Key themes I am exploring:

- Integrating concepts and measurement of spatial inequality into evidence about place-based inequalities.
- Working collaboratively with cities and regions to design bespoke digital planning tools (e.g., urban indicators, Digital Twins) that support decision making around large scale investment decisions. 
- Exploring new techniques for stakeholder engagement with insights from spatial data (e.g., narrative story maps)

## Research Approach and Methodologies

I primarily work in `R`, though for specialised applications such as network analysis or dashboard development I will use other programming languages (e.g., `Python`) or softwares (e.g., ArcGIS). Below I have listed my main methodological specialisms: 

* Spatial Analysis
* Spatial Modelling
* Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
* Statistics
* Area Classifications and Geodemographics
* Scoring and Indicator Development
* Network Analysis
* Data Visualisation and Cartography
* Dashboards
* Digital Twins
