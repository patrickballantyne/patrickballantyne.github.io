Collaborating with Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA), the project will develop innovative tools, such as a narrative dashboard to guide targeted investments for safer pedestrian infrastructure. This initiative directly supports the region’s ambitious ‘Vision Zero’ goal to reduce traffic collisions, improving walkability and safety for residents. Beyond the immediate technological advancements, this project will lay the foundation for deeper, long-term collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry experts, fostering new partnerships and creating a framework to pursue larger funding opportunities for future transport innovations.\nWhat makes this project particularly exciting is its potential for far-reaching impact. By addressing key UKRI challenges such as “creating opportunities, improving outcomes” and “accelerating towards a net zero carbon future,” the project not only aims to improve pedestrian safety, but also contributes to a more sustainable, effective transport system in Liverpool. The formation of a new strategic working group and the strengthening of existing partnerships between University of Liverpool and Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, will catalyse a new agenda to secure large-scale funding, which can drive a pipeline of data-driven transport investments, innovations and measurable impact over the next decade."

This evidence base, comprising a suite of urban indicators and city dashboards, is now being used to allocate investment from the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements. The tools and evidence developed have been used to provide policymakers with ready-to-use insights for policy efforts in the region and have been used to identify priority neighbourhoods for investment as well as evaluate new planning scheme proposals. You can read the two published articles on the topic here and here.\nAt the same time, researchers at the University of Liverpool (Patrick Ballantyne , Heeseo Rain Kwon) have recently embarked on a collaborative research & development project funded by Innovate UK. This project, which brings together public, private and academic sector collaborators from the UK and South Korea, will focus on designing a “Digital Twin” of Liverpool City Region’s bus network. The “Digital Twin” leverages Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to design a new franchised bus network which prioritises efficiency, reliability and equity. You can read more about the project here.\nThese collaborations with Liverpool City Region Combined Authority highlight the real benefits of collaboration between policymakers and academics. Policymakers can present key strategic and political targets for cities and regions (e.g. Net Zero), and academic researchers can collaborate with them to design robust empirical analyses that contribute evidence and insights vital to delivery of these targets."

This was an exciting opportunity to collaborate with external policymakers to generate positive outcomes for the city region around Transport, Health, Economic Development and Housing.\n\n\nLiverpool City Region Combined Authority approached Alex and I about doing some freelance consultancy for them on a project to help them secure and utilise funding for a series of projects around the City Region. We discussed their needs and wants in terms of data and outputs, and developed a work specification which covered creation of a series of data products spanning four key domains.\nThe project comprised two main stages\n\nDevelopment of indicators and data products\nRepresentation of indicators and data products on an interactive web mapping platform.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of Indicators and Data Products\nBringing together resources from LCRCA, the CDRC and other openly-available datasets, we produced a number of aggregate indices spanning four domains, each based on a series of individual data products.\n\nDomain 1. Access to the Transport Network\nWe produced an aggregated accessibility score (at LSOA level), which details the overall transport accessibility of the city region. In particular it incorporates measures of:\n\nDistances to bus stops and railway stations (at postcode level).\nDistances to active travel routes, cycle lanes etc. (at postcode level).\nAverage reliability of bus services in local areas.\nAverage congestion along the key route network, main roads, motorways etc.\nAccessibility of railway stations, step-free access etc.\n\n\n\n\nDomain 2. Health and Deprivation\nWe produced an aggregated health/deprivation score (at LSOA level), which details the overall trends in health and deprivation within the city region. In particular, it incorporates measures of:\n\nDeprivation, IMD rescaled to within the city region.\nSocio-economic status, utilising data from the 2021 census (NS-SEC).\nDevolved programme users.\nSkills bootcamp users.\n\n\n\n\nDomain 3. Economic Development and Housing\nWe produced an aggregated economic development/housing score (at LSOA level), which details the overall trends in economic development within the city region. In particular, it incorporates measures of:\n\nExisting households.\nEnergy efficiency of households.\nEmployment concentration, utilising data on major employer floorspace.\nInnovation, utilising data from the 2021 census.\n\nWe also produced a number of other data products, to meet the individual needs of LCRCA, including calculating volume of freight moving through LCRCA road network, locations of freeports and investment locations and total future housing supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would first like to thank the team at LCR CA, notably Sam and Libbie, for reaching out to us and for providing the opportunity to engage with the LCR CA. It has been a really positive experience, and in particular has been really interesting to see how some of the ‘day-to-day’ stuff we do in the GDSL can be put to use in the public sector.\nSecondly, to all the data providers at LCR CA (and specialists) who have facilitated access to the datasets and resolved any queries we have with them.\n\n\n\nData Availability Statement\nOwing to the commercial sensitivity of this project, much of the data used and data products derived are not available for public consumption.

Workshop attendees included representatives from each of the project partner organisations, including Podaris, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) and the University of Liverpool from the UK, as well as Sundosoft, Busan Metropolitan City, Busan Techno Park (BTP) and Pusan National University from South Korea.\n\nHosted by Pusan National University and Sundosoft, the workshops enabled the project partners to meet in person for the first time, and provide progress updates on the technical co-development of Digital Twins for Liverpool’s bus network and the Busan North port redevelopment area. Discussion topics included availability of high-resolution automatic vehicle location (AVL) data, design of scenarios and KPIs within the Digital Twins, stakeholder and user priorities, and the delivery of prototypes through technical collaborations between Podaris and Sundosoft.\nResearchers from the University of Liverpool reported on their ongoing collaborations with LCRCA, particularly around the co-development of data-driven insights to support transport investment in the region, as documented in this paper and this paper. They also introduced their ongoing academic research collaborations with PNU, where both institutions are working on a review of academic literature on the topic to support better understanding of the ‘readiness’ of global cities for urban Digital Twins. We are also really excited to be taking part in a student exchange programme, with our PhD student - Ákos Balog - who is remaining in Korea until Christmas to support collaborative efforts on this project.\n\nIn addition to project meetings and guest lectures, the UK project partners enjoyed a number of interesting site visits during the week, including a tour of the Busan North port development area - the study site for the Sundosoft-led Digital Twin. Furthermore, the UK partners visited Busan Techno Park’s Big Data Innovation Center, where they learned more about how BTP supports local government, academics and businesses by providing access to a large portfolio of data.\n \nLooking ahead, the UK and South Korean project partners have a jam-packed Autumn and Winter of R&D collaborations ahead. The University of Liverpool is really looking forward to hosting the South Korean partners in January, where we will be showcasing a set of Digital Twin prototypes for Liverpool and Busan, and mapping out our plans for large-scale operationalisation and commercialisation of the prototypes as part of a Phase II application to Innovate UK in February."

Researchers will create a ‘digital twin’ (digital replica) of the city region’s transport system to accurately model the effects of different scenarios – such as route changes and fare reductions – to provide a better service for the local community, reduce journey times and ultimately encourage more residents to take the bus. The ‘digital twin’ will use state-of-the-art data modelling techniques and real-time vehicle location data to help transport leaders achieve greater connectivity across the region, benefitting residents and helping reduce transport inequalities. Hundreds of thousands of people use Liverpool City Region’s bus network each day, with around 82% of public transport journeys currently taken by bus. It builds on strong links with South Korea’s second city that last year saw Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Mayor of Busan Metropolitan City Park Heong-Joon to promote active co-operation in areas relating to digital innovation and smart cities, net zero and clean energy and health innovation."

I also introduced a new analytical framework for viewing transport accessibility as two-dimensional, particularly highlighting places where high levels of demand for sustainable transport are not met with good quality transport infrastructure, based on this paper.\n\nI also introduced some working research projects. I introduced a new spatial optimisation model which integrates infrastructure data, urban amenities, population data and road traffic collisions data to identify a set of optimal locations for new transport infrastructure. The model, which is based on network analysis tools and an urban indicator scoring approach, is able to capture the multidimensionality of factors associated with infrastructure location.\n\nThe other project I provided an overview of was the Innovate UK-funded bus Digital Twin project that is coming to the end of its first phase in January. In particular, I provided some technical details of the model, notably how it translates complex data about the bus network and city into an estimated GTFS feed given a variety of scenarios.\n\nFinally, I wanted to reflect on what the key lessons are that I’ve learned from two years of working with an external partner such as Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which you can see summarised below."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Inadequate supply of transport infrastructure is often seen as a barrier to a sustainable future for cities globally. Such barriers often perpetuate significant inequalities in who can and who cannot benefit from sustainable transport opportunities, and as a result there is momentum for transformative urban planning to promote sustainable transportation equity. This study introduces a new set of two-dimensional indicators, merging elements of supply and demand, to identify barriers and imbalances in sustainable transport equity. The accessibility indicators, which are generated for bus, rail, and cycle infrastructure, consider the proximity of administrative areas to good quality transport infrastructure, as well as mode-specific demand, to clearly identify areas where the supply of infrastructure is inadequate to support local populations. We present a policy case study for Liverpool City Region, which demonstrates how these indicators can be used in an analytical framework to support transformative urban planning in the long-term . In particular, the indicators reveal policy priority areas where demand for sustainable transport is greater than supply, as well as neighbourhoods where multiple transport inequalities are intersecting spatially, highlighting the need for specific types of infrastructure investment to promote sustainable transport equity (e.g. more frequent services, additional cycle paths). Our framework lays the foundations for improved decision-making in urban systems, through development of mode-specific sustainable transport indicators at small area levels, which harmonise elements of supply and demand for the first time."

    "text": "Inadequate supply of transport infrastructure is often seen as a barrier to a sustainable future for cities globally. Such barriers often perpetuate significant inequalities in who can and who cannot benefit from sustainable transport opportunities, and as a result there is momentum for transformative urban planning to promote sustainable transportation equity. This study introduces a new set of two-dimensional indicators, merging elements of supply and demand, to identify barriers and imbalances in sustainable transport equity. The accessibility indicators, which are generated for bus, rail, and cycle infrastructure, consider the proximity of administrative areas to good quality transport infrastructure, as well as mode-specific demand, to clearly identify areas where the supply of infrastructure is inadequate to support local populations. We present a policy case study for Liverpool City Region, which demonstrates how these indicators can be used in an analytical framework to support transformative urban planning in the long-term .

Yet, empirical evidence of these impacts, specifically at the national level, or focusing on latter periods of the pandemic remain notably absent. Using a large spatio-temporal mobility dataset, which exhibits significant temporal instability, we explore the recovery of retail centres from summer 2021 to 2022, considering in particular how these responses are determined by the functional and structural characteristics of retail centres and their regional geography. Our findings provide important empirical evidence of the multidimensionality of retail centre recovery, highlighting in particular the importance of composition, e-resilience and catchment deprivation in determining such trajectories, and identifying key retail centre functions and regions that appear to be recovering faster than others. In addition, we present a use case for mobility data that exhibits temporal stability, highlighting the benefits of viewing mobility data as a series of snapshots rather than a complete time series. It is our view that such data, when controlling for temporal stability, can provide a useful way to monitor the economic performance of retail centres over time, providing evidence that can inform policy decisions, and support interventions to both acute and longer-term issues in the retail sector."

Efforts to understand the geographies of retail centers, the cores of retailing in urban areas, have a long academic tradition, often studied through either rich local case studies, or when geographically more expansive, are constrained by limited detail. New data in United States detailing the location and uses of retail creates a significant opportunity to develop a more complete and comprehensive overview of the national retail system, at a high spatial resolution. This research is rooted in a pragmatic effort to provide the first and most comprehensive model of U.S. retail center geographies, through development of an integrated, conceptual, and empirically grounded framework, using data from SafeGraph, to examine where they are located, what characteristics they have, and who uses them. The resulting geographies are of great interest, creating significant potential in the monitoring of the national retail system as it continues to evolve in response to wider structural challenges. Furthermore, by integrating these three geographies (where, what, and who), we establish a conceptual framework that yields substantive insights about the relationships between each of them, and argues that understandings of U.S. retail center geographies are more comprehensive and useful when considering the who, what, and where together."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Transportation systems worldwide are facing numerous challenges, including congestion, environmental impacts, and safety concerns. This study used a systematic literature review to investigate how advanced technologies (e.g., IoT, AI, digital twins, and optimization methods) support smart transportation planning. Specifically, this study examines the interrelationships between transportation challenges, proposed solutions, and enabling technologies, providing insights into how these innovations support smart mobility initiatives. A systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2024, including studies that examined smart transportation technologies. To quantitatively assess relationships among key concepts, a Sentence BERT-based natural language processing approach was employed to compute alignment scores between transportation challenges, technological solutions, and implementation strategies. The findings highlight the fact that real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and digital twin simulations significantly enhance traffic flow, safety, and operational efficiency while mitigating environmental impacts. The analysis further reveals strong correlations between traffic congestion and public transit optimization, reinforcing the effectiveness of integrated, data-driven strategies. Additionally, IoT-based sensor networks and AI-driven decision-support systems are shown to play a critical role in sustainable urban mobility by enabling proactive congestion management, multimodal transportation planning, and emission reduction strategies. From a policy perspective, this study underscores the need for investment in urban-scale data infrastructures, the integration of digital twin modeling into long-term planning frameworks, and the alignment of optimization tools with public transit improvements to foster equitable and efficient mobility. These findings offer actionable recommendations for policymakers, engineers, and planners, guiding data-driven resource allocation and legislative strategies that support sustainable, adaptive, and technologically advanced transportation ecosystems."

    "text": "Early Career Researchers (ECRs) encounter distinctive opportunities (and challenges) within the neoliberal academy. In this commentary, we reflect on issues common to ECR experiences in quantitative human geography. Our discussion is inspired by and develops conversations from a panel at the Royal Geographical Society Institute of British Geographers (RGS-IBG) postgraduate forum, with panelists from across the subfield.

We find that WFH patterns recorded by the 2021 Census were unique compared with previous UK censuses, reflecting an unprecedented increase likely caused by persistent changes to employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a clear social gradient emerging across the country. We also find that Google mobility in ‘Residential’ and ‘Workplace’ settings provides a reliable measurement of the distribution of WFH populations across Local Authorities, with varying uncertainties for mobility indicators collected in different settings. These findings provide insights into the utility of such datasets to support population research in intercensal periods, where shifts may be occurring, but can be difficult to quantify empirically."

Alongside Hamish Gibbs (UCL), I presented our latest research on the use of Smart Data to examine changing work from home behaviours over the last couple of censuses. The research, which is imminently awaiting release at The Geographical Journal, harmonises census data and google mobility data for Local Authority Districts, and asks whether new forms of data can replace the census, through examining changing work from home behaviours, and social and spatial inequalities in working from home. The slides for my talk are available here.\nThe conference is a great opportunity to experience a more ‘commercial’ side of academia, catching up with CDRC partners like Geolytix, Homes for England and Pets at Home, and enjoying a series of talks on Data and Geodemographics. A particular highlight for me was the real appetite for the latest Output Area Classification (OAC) and the innovative ways in which Geodemographics have been used to support better marketing for theatre shows like The Book of Mormon.\nThanks to the CDRC for another fantastic event - especially Paul, Alex, James, Rebecca and Jonathan.\n\n\n\nPhotos"

In particular, along with other CDRC colleagues, we ran an exhibition stand across the week, promoting all the work we do at the CDRC, and distributing lots of CDRC merchandise.\nA really common theme in lots of the sessions was the vast potential of new forms of data or digital footprints data, as well as the ways in which we can use ChatGPT to support out analyses as researchers. I took a lot away from the sessions, and have begun to formulate lots of ideas for future research projects around urban mobility, neighbourhoods, and the use of emerging sources of data and technologies to answer important questions.\nThe conference was also an excellent opportunity for me to re-engage with the wider GIS/GIScience academic research community following completion of my PhD, expanding my network and establishing future collaboration opportunities, whilst also giving me the time to explore and enjoy everything Glasgow has to offer.\nA huge kudos to Ana and Guy for another excellent GISRUK - looking forward to Leeds GISRUK in 2024!\n\n\n\nPhotos"

Here are some thoughts on the experience…\n\nOn the 2nd March, I successfully defended my ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training PhD thesis at Liverpool University.\nA huge thank you to my examiners Prof. Scott Orford, Cardiff University, Prof. Mark Birkin, University of Leeds and Dr. Mark Green, University of Liverpool. It was a hugely enjoyable experience getting to discuss the work that I have spent the last four years completing.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nUndertaking a PhD amidst a global pandemic has presented significant challenges; nearly two years of mobility and travel restrictions have altered what is a ‘typical’ PhD experience. I feel that without the support of some key people, I would not have been able to successfully complete this thesis, so at this point I would like to pay tribute to some of these amazing people, and thank them for their help and support.\nFirstly, to Prof. Alex Singleton, for his continuous academic (and personal) support throughout my PhD. Over the past four years, Alex has been incredibly kind, and ensured that my skills are refined and targeted at specific projects, to ensure I could complete my studies in time, whilst listening to my own interests and giving me plenty of ownership over my project. Alex has also given me lots of encouragement and opportunities to expand my academic portfolio, network and career, going above and beyond as a PhD supervisor, dedicating significant time to issues I have had over the past four years. I really appreciate the time and effort he put into this PhD project, helping shape me into the researcher I am today, and for that I am truly grateful.\nSecondly, to my secondary supervisor Dr. Les Dolega. Les has always been on hand to offer support and advice on life in general, as well as how best to frame my research projects within the field of retail geography, often turning a paper/chapter draft around with constructive comments in a matter of days. I am particularly grateful to Les for his encouragement during my time as a Research Assistant and in the early months of my new role at Liverpool, which has given me the confidence to continue my academic journey at Liverpool as a Postdoctoral Researcher, and my interests in retail geography.\nThirdly, to my other co-authors Jacob Macdonald and Kevin Credit, as well as to the early-career panellists, Rachael Sanderson, and members of the QMRG committee, whom I worked with on a written commentary for the Geographical Journal. These people were instrumental in helping to push further publications over the line with their expertise and advice, but also gave me the opportunity to collaborate externally with other academics outside of Liverpool, which has opened a number of opportunities since, and inspired me to continue my academic journey.\nThanks to all at the CDRC, SafeGraph and Geolytix who have provided data that has been invaluable to my PhD. In particular, a big thanks to SafeGraph, who through their ‘Data for Academics’ programme made the primary objective of this PhD thesis feasible, following months of searching for useful and accessible sources of data on retailer locations for the U.S.\nI also want to thank all of my colleagues at the Geographic Data Science Lab and CDRC, who have offered me general support, advice, and friendship, reviewed drafts of papers and been there to listen when I am facing significant challenges in my research. The GDSL has been a fantastic place to do a PhD, with each and every member having an impact on my overall PhD experience. There are too many people to mention here, but I particularly wanted to acknowledge the contributions of Alessia Calafiore, Martin Fleischmann, Maurizio Gibin (CDRC), Ollie O’Brien (CDRC), May Chen (CDRC), Natalie Rose, Olivia Horsefield, Dan Owen, Sian Teesdale, James Murphy, Krasen Samardzhiev, Nikos Patias, Michael Mahony, Maya Middleton-Welch, Francisco Rowe, Dani Arribas-Bel, Mark Green, Caitlin Robinson, Jeremiah Nieves, Ron Mahabir and Olga Gkountouna, all of whom have contributed in some way to ensuring my PhD is a success.\nI also wanted to thank some of my closest friends, for their undying support over the past four years. Particular thanks to Tilly Clough, Ella Bytheway-Jackson, Libby Hopkins, John O’Neill, Jess Cerasale, Elaine Reilly and Clare Bohan, who have been there at various stages of my academic journey. Thank you to all of you for listening, discussing, supporting, and looking out for me over the past four years, and being there to celebrate my major achievements.\nA final thanks goes to Mum and Dad. As the first of the family to go to university and first to complete a PhD, I want to thank you both for your undying support and understanding over the last 8 years, especially when I was facing significant personal issues or struggling with the pressures of doing a PhD in a pandemic. Your love and care during this time has given me the opportunity to flourish in my academic career without any major concerns or stresses, and I will be eternally grateful for this, especially given the challenges you already face with Liam. Unfortunately, Dad you can’t retire just yet (haha), but I hope to one day return the favour to you both.\n\n\n\nDownload my thesis\nThe final accepted version of my PhD thesis is available to read here."

I introduced the room to a number of previous colleagues of mine, all of whom have gone on to do great things in industry, as well as situating such developments within the context of growing interest in geospatial skills by the UK government. My top tips to students in the room were the following:\n\nYour toolbox should have no lid - don’t let yourself get too comfortable in using certain techniques and methods. The broadness of your skillset is what will set you apart.\nAdapt, adapt, adapt - always be ready to adapt to new trends, tools and developments in the sector if you want to be successful. The geospatial sector moves quickly, and you have to be ready to follow.\nBe seen everywhere, by everybody - put yourself and your achievements on display for the world to see. If you are talented and active on social media platforms, you will not struggle to get a job."
