Last summer I took part in my first half marathon race in Chester, and one day hope to complete a full marathon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\nMusic is a big part of my life. I grew up learning the fiddle and banjo, competing at international competitions or ‘fleadhs’ and touring the UK and Ireland in 2016 to commemorate 100 years since the Easter Rising.\nNow, I can usually be found over in Ireland during the summer holidays playing in sessions with my friends or going to music festivals across Ireland and the UK. I also play regularly in and around pubs in Liverpool, and volunteer as secretary or ‘runai’ for Comhaltas in Britain, helping to promote irish traditional music, song and dance throughout the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoodie\nI love to eat out and go out for drinks with my friends, with a particular obsession over tacos, ramen, craft beer, coffee and donuts.\nSome of my favourite places in Liverpool include Koffi, The Pen Factory, The Grapes, Free State Kitchen and Mother Espresso."

This paper presents a framework through which formal definitions and typologies of retail centres, such as those in the UK, can be extended to the US. Using Chicago as a case study and data from SafeGraph, we present a retail centre delineation method that combines Hierarchical-DBSCAN with ‘H3’, and demonstrate the usefulness of a non-hierarchical approach to retail classification. In addition, we show that the dynamicity and comprehensibility of retail centres make them an effective tool through which to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on retail centre ‘health’, demonstrating significant scope for a comprehensive delineation of the scale, extent and characteristics of American retail centre agglomerations, providing a tool through which to monitor the evolution of American retail."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Retail is an important function at the core of urban areas, occupying a key role in determining their economic prosperity, desirability, and vibrancy. Efforts to understand the geographies of retail centers, the cores of retailing in urban areas, have a long academic tradition, often studied through either rich local case studies, or when geographically more expansive, are constrained by limited detail. New data in United States detailing the location and uses of retail creates a significant opportunity to develop a more complete and comprehensive overview of the national retail system, at a high spatial resolution. This research is rooted in a pragmatic effort to provide the first and most comprehensive model of U.S. retail center geographies, through development of an integrated, conceptual, and empirically grounded framework, using data from SafeGraph, to examine where they are located, what characteristics they have, and who uses them. The resulting geographies are of great interest, creating significant potential in the monitoring of the national retail system as it continues to evolve in response to wider structural challenges. Furthermore, by integrating these three geographies (where, what, and who), we establish a conceptual framework that yields substantive insights about the relationships between each of them, and argues that understandings of U.S. retail center geographies are more comprehensive and useful when considering the who, what, and where together."

In this commentary, we reflect on issues common to ECR experiences in quantitative human geography. Our discussion is inspired by and develops conversations from a panel at the Royal Geographical Society Institute of British Geographers (RGS-IBG) postgraduate forum, with panelists from across the subfield. Whilst many aspects of the ECR experience transcend sub-disciplinary boundaries, the quantitative subfield presents unique dynamics for ECRs to navigate. ECRs in quantitative geography are steeped in ‘data science’, which changes relations between academia and industry, with the growth of our field increasing the size and the scope of what ECRs might be expected to know and do. Bringing together reflections from the panel, we highlight the variation in pathways experienced by ECRs, reflecting on opportunities, uncertainties and mentorship, in the hope of offering insights and advice for prospective and current ECRs and their mentors."

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the ways in which we shop, with significant impacts on retail and consumption spaces. Yet, empirical evidence of these impacts, specifically at the national level, or focusing on latter periods of the pandemic remain notably absent. Using a large spatio-temporal mobility dataset, which exhibits significant temporal instability, we explore the recovery of retail centres from summer 2021 to 2022, considering in particular how these responses are determined by the functional and structural characteristics of retail centres and their regional geography. Our findings provide important empirical evidence of the multidimensionality of retail centre recovery, highlighting in particular the importance of composition, e-resilience and catchment deprivation in determining such trajectories, and identifying key retail centre functions and regions that appear to be recovering faster than others. In addition, we present a use case for mobility data that exhibits temporal stability, highlighting the benefits of viewing mobility data as a series of snapshots rather than a complete time series. It is our view that such data, when controlling for temporal stability, can provide a useful way to monitor the economic performance of retail centres over time, providing evidence that can inform policy decisions, and support interventions to both acute and longer-term issues in the retail sector."

We find that WFH patterns recorded by the 2021 Census were unique compared with previous UK censuses, reflecting an unprecedented increase likely caused by persistent changes to employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a clear social gradient emerging across the country. We also find that Google mobility in ‘Residential’ and ‘Workplace’ settings provides a reliable measurement of the distribution of WFH populations across Local Authorities, with varying uncertainties for mobility indicators collected in different settings. These findings provide insights into the utility of such datasets to support population research in intercensal periods, where shifts may be occurring, but can be difficult to quantify empirically."

In this article, we provide a processed version of the Overture places (POI) dataset for the UK, in a fully queryable format, and provide accompanying code through which to explore the data, and generate other national subsets. In the article, we describe the construction and characteristics of this new open data product, before evaluating its quality in relation to ISO standards, through direct comparison with Geolytix supermarket data.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Spatial inequality is a common urban phenomena in cities around the world, where stark contrasts in a variety of different social and economic outcomes paint a vivid picture of compound inequalities. Tackling these influences from a policy perspective remains challenging, as political economies often span multiple actors and municipal bodies, lacking effective policy instruments to challenge multiple forms of inequality at once. This paper provides a new data-driven perspective, which seeks to improve how policy is developed when trying to mitigate the impacts of compound inequality. Utilising a place-based approach, we present an evidence base which has been co-produced with policymakers, comprising composite spatial indicators and a city dashboard for Liverpool City Region. The assembled evidence base highlights clear patterns of compound inequality across the region, identifying places in greatest need of support. In the paper we discuss how this evidence base is now being used to distribute investment from the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements, generating positive outcomes for people and places across the region. Finally, we conclude by reflecting on the benefits of building collaborative relationships between academics and policymakers, and the utility of our approach, which uses urban indicators and city dashboards, which we argue can secure a more equitable future for cities globally."

    "text": "Inadequate supply of transport infrastructure is often seen as a barrier to a sustainable future for cities globally. Such barriers often perpetuate significant inequalities in who can and who cannot benefit from sustainable transport opportunities, and as a result there is momentum for transformative urban planning to promote sustainable transportation equity. This study introduces a new set of two-dimensional indicators, merging elements of supply and demand, to identify barriers and imbalances in sustainable transport equity. The accessibility indicators, which are generated for bus, rail, and cycle infrastructure, consider the proximity of administrative areas to good quality transport infrastructure, as well as mode-specific demand, to clearly identify areas where the supply of infrastructure is inadequate to support local populations. We present a policy case study for Liverpool City Region, which demonstrates how these indicators can be used in an analytical framework to support transformative urban planning in the long-term . In particular, the indicators reveal policy priority areas where demand for sustainable transport is greater than supply, as well as neighbourhoods where multiple transport inequalities are intersecting spatially, highlighting the need for specific types of infrastructure investment to promote sustainable transport equity (e.g. more frequent services, additional cycle paths). Our framework lays the foundations for improved decision-making in urban systems, through development of mode-specific sustainable transport indicators at small area levels, which harmonise elements of supply and demand for the first time."

Together with Prof. Rachel Franklin and Prof. Alex Singleton we put together three sessions entitled - “Geography and Data Science for Public Good: Data-Driven Evidence and Solutions to Social and Spatial Inequalities”. The abstract call invited participants to present their research which leverages the power of Geography, Data Science and GIS to unearth new evidence about the existence of social and spatial inequalities, and support policy to mitigate the impacts of social and spatial inequalities.\nWe were delighted to receive such a large volume of abstracts, and as such were able to put on three sessions to showcase the best in policy-focused, data-driven geographic research, as listed below:\n\n\nI also delivered a talk in these sessions, summarising two recent projects that I have completed in partnership with Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The talk was focused on how we can build and customised urban indicators to meet policy-specific needs, and the utility of urban indicators and city dashboards for place-based policymaking. In the talk, I placed a particular emphasis on highlighting how our evidence is helping to make Liverpool City Region more equitable, and through encouraging improvements to transport infrastructure, it is hoped that our research will also promote further mode shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation. My slides are available to view here.\n \nAs well as having a blast at the conference itself, I also got the opportunity to enjoy everything that Hawaii has to offer.

    "text": "Eurovision’s Economic Impact in Liverpool: Insights for Future Large-Scale Events\nA year on from Liverpool hosting Eurovision, and just 2 weeks before Taylor Swift’s huge Anfield gigs, our new policy brief uses spending data from Mastercard to highlight new insights into the economic impact of mega events. it demonstrates the spatial and sectoral economic impacts of Eurovision 2023, building on work completed by Liverpool City Council, Liverpool City Region and the Heseltine Institute for Public Policy. Results demonstrated that Eurovision 2023 generated significant uplifts in spending in bars and restaurants, and created a hyper-localised ‘boom’ in spending in the area surrounding the Eurovision Village. These insights can help to inform decision-making about the location of mega events and their impact on local economies, and the design of fringe events which can support local businesses. Furthermore, the methodology employed here demonstrates the value of data partnerships with private companies and could be used to assess the economic impact of future mega events such as the UK leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour."

    "text": "Context\nThis new hi-tech collaboration between UK and South Korea project partners is aimed at improving bus journey times and connectivity in the Liverpool City Region. Researchers will create a ‘digital twin’ (digital replica) of the city region’s transport system to accurately model the effects of different scenarios – such as route changes and fare reductions – to provide a better service for the local community, reduce journey times and ultimately encourage more residents to take the bus. The ‘digital twin’ will use state-of-the-art data modelling techniques and real-time vehicle location data to help transport leaders achieve greater connectivity across the region, benefitting residents and helping reduce transport inequalities. Hundreds of thousands of people use Liverpool City Region’s bus network each day, with around 82% of public transport journeys currently taken by bus. It builds on strong links with South Korea’s second city that last year saw Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Mayor of Busan Metropolitan City Park Heong-Joon to promote active co-operation in areas relating to digital innovation and smart cities, net zero and clean energy and health innovation."

This workshop, co-delivered with Prof. Francisco Rowe, aimed to provide a gentle introduction to R, before building progressively to cover more advanced topics such as dashboard construction, APIs and time-series modelling.\n\n\nEarlier in the year I was approached by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) policy analyst team to design and deliver a bespoke training course, which could provide their team with the skills needed to use R in their daily workflows. The class comprised a mixture of people very familiar with programming languages as well as those who had never programmed before. Together with Prof. Rowe, I delivered four days of content covering the following topics:\n\nR Fundamentals\nData Visualisation\nDashboards and APIs\nData Modelling (Time-Series)\n\nIt was a great opportunity for me to design a new course from scratch, and work collaboratively with a senior colleague to think about how best to teach this course to such a diverse range of abilities. Below I provide a sample of some of the outputs from this work, however we are unfortunately able to share these materials as they are owned by LCRCA."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Acknowledgements\nUndertaking a PhD amidst a global pandemic has presented significant challenges; nearly two years of mobility and travel restrictions have altered what is a ‘typical’ PhD experience. I feel that without the support of some key people, I would not have been able to successfully complete this thesis, so at this point I would like to pay tribute to some of these amazing people, and thank them for their help and support.\nFirstly, to Prof. Alex Singleton, for his continuous academic (and personal) support throughout my PhD. Over the past four years, Alex has been incredibly kind, and ensured that my skills are refined and targeted at specific projects, to ensure I could complete my studies in time, whilst listening to my own interests and giving me plenty of ownership over my project. Alex has also given me lots of encouragement and opportunities to expand my academic portfolio, network and career, going above and beyond as a PhD supervisor, dedicating significant time to issues I have had over the past four years. I really appreciate the time and effort he put into this PhD project, helping shape me into the researcher I am today, and for that I am truly grateful.\nSecondly, to my secondary supervisor Dr. Les Dolega. Les has always been on hand to offer support and advice on life in general, as well as how best to frame my research projects within the field of retail geography, often turning a paper/chapter draft around with constructive comments in a matter of days. I am particularly grateful to Les for his encouragement during my time as a Research Assistant and in the early months of my new role at Liverpool, which has given me the confidence to continue my academic journey at Liverpool as a Postdoctoral Researcher, and my interests in retail geography.\nThirdly, to my other co-authors Jacob Macdonald and Kevin Credit, as well as to the early-career panellists, Rachael Sanderson, and members of the QMRG committee, whom I worked with on a written commentary for the Geographical Journal. These people were instrumental in helping to push further publications over the line with their expertise and advice, but also gave me the opportunity to collaborate externally with other academics outside of Liverpool, which has opened a number of opportunities since, and inspired me to continue my academic journey.\nThanks to all at the CDRC, SafeGraph and Geolytix who have provided data that has been invaluable to my PhD. In particular, a big thanks to SafeGraph, who through their ‘Data for Academics’ programme made the primary objective of this PhD thesis feasible, following months of searching for useful and accessible sources of data on retailer locations for the U.S.\nI also want to thank all of my colleagues at the Geographic Data Science Lab and CDRC, who have offered me general support, advice, and friendship, reviewed drafts of papers and been there to listen when I am facing significant challenges in my research. The GDSL has been a fantastic place to do a PhD, with each and every member having an impact on my overall PhD experience. There are too many people to mention here, but I particularly wanted to acknowledge the contributions of Alessia Calafiore, Martin Fleischmann, Maurizio Gibin (CDRC), Ollie O’Brien (CDRC), May Chen (CDRC), Natalie Rose, Olivia Horsefield, Dan Owen, Sian Teesdale, James Murphy, Krasen Samardzhiev, Nikos Patias, Michael Mahony, Maya Middleton-Welch, Francisco Rowe, Dani Arribas-Bel, Mark Green, Caitlin Robinson, Jeremiah Nieves, Ron Mahabir and Olga Gkountouna, all of whom have contributed in some way to ensuring my PhD is a success.\nI also wanted to thank some of my closest friends, for their undying support over the past four years. Particular thanks to Tilly Clough, Ella Bytheway-Jackson, Libby Hopkins, John O’Neill, Jess Cerasale, Elaine Reilly and Clare Bohan, who have been there at various stages of my academic journey. Thank you to all of you for listening, discussing, supporting, and looking out for me over the past four years, and being there to celebrate my major achievements.\nA final thanks goes to Mum and Dad. As the first of the family to go to university and first to complete a PhD, I want to thank you both for your undying support and understanding over the last 8 years, especially when I was facing significant personal issues or struggling with the pressures of doing a PhD in a pandemic. Your love and care during this time has given me the opportunity to flourish in my academic career without any major concerns or stresses, and I will be eternally grateful for this, especially given the challenges you already face with Liam. Unfortunately, Dad you can’t retire just yet (haha), but I hope to one day return the favour to you both.\n\n\n\nDownload my thesis\nThe final accepted version of my PhD thesis is available to read here."

I introduced the room to a number of previous colleagues of mine, all of whom have gone on to do great things in industry, as well as situating such developments within the context of growing interest in geospatial skills by the UK government. My top tips to students in the room were the following:\n\nYour toolbox should have no lid - don’t let yourself get too comfortable in using certain techniques and methods. The broadness of your skillset is what will set you apart.\nAdapt, adapt, adapt - always be ready to adapt to new trends, tools and developments in the sector if you want to be successful. The geospatial sector moves quickly, and you have to be ready to follow.\nBe seen everywhere, by everybody - put yourself and your achievements on display for the world to see. If you are talented and active on social media platforms, you will not struggle to get a job."

My research in this area explores a number of important ideas:\n\nWhat are the geographies of retail centre agglomerations - where are they located, what characteristics do they have and who uses them?\nHow is the composition and economic performance of retail centres and high streets changing?\nIn what ways is consumer behaviour changing, how can we measure this, and what are the social, economic and environmental consequences of these shifts?\n\n\n\n2) Spatial Inequality, Accessibility and Place-Based Policy\nSpatial inequality is a common phenomena in cities around the world, maintaining cycles of hardship for the most vulnerable members of society. My research in this area aims to unlock new insights about inequalities between places, and support evidence-led policy making to target these. My ongoing research focuses particularly on:\n\nThe development of digital planning tools (e.g. city dashboards, digital twins) to support place-based policy targeting spatial inequalities.\nAssembly of urban indicators that summarise the complexity of multidimensional inequalities (e.g. multi-modal transport access and usage) into meaningful and accessible representations.\nMeasurement of place-based inequalities in accessibility to essential services and amenities, utilising new open data from Overture Maps."
