    "text": "Hobbies and Interests\n\nRunning\nI am a big fan of running, and can often be found panting and sweating my way around Sefton Park or along the Promenade at the weekends.\nDuring lockdown, I completed the ‘Couch to 5k’ challenge and got completely hooked on running. Last summer I took part in my first half marathon race in Chester, and one day hope to complete a full marathon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\nMusic is a big part of my life. I grew up learning the fiddle and banjo, competing at international competitions or ‘fleadhs’ and touring the UK and Ireland in 2016 to commemorate 100 years since the Easter Rising.\nNow, I can usually be found over in Ireland during the summer holidays playing in sessions with my friends or going to music festivals across Ireland and the UK.\nAside from Irish music, I spend way too much time on Spotify. This year I was in the top 0.001% of people who listened to Coldplay (haha ikr), and am getting very excited for Eurovision here in Liverpool later next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoodie\nI love to eat out and go out for drinks with my friends, with a particular obsession over tacos, ramen, craft beer, coffee and donuts.\nSome of my favourite places in Liverpool include Koffi, The Pen Factory, The Grapes, Free State Kitchen and Mother Espresso."

    "text": "Retail centres are important tools for understanding the distribution and evolution of the retail sector at varying geographical scales. This paper presents a framework through which formal definitions and typologies of retail centres, such as those in the UK, can be extended to the US. Using Chicago as a case study and data from SafeGraph, we present a retail centre delineation method that combines Hierarchical-DBSCAN with ‘H3’, and demonstrate the usefulness of a non-hierarchical approach to retail classification. In addition, we show that the dynamicity and comprehensibility of retail centres make them an effective tool through which to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on retail centre ‘health’, demonstrating significant scope for a comprehensive delineation of the scale, extent and characteristics of American retail centre agglomerations, providing a tool through which to monitor the evolution of American retail."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Retail is an important function at the core of urban areas, occupying a key role in determining their economic prosperity, desirability, and vibrancy. Efforts to understand the geographies of retail centers, the cores of retailing in urban areas, have a long academic tradition, often studied through either rich local case studies, or when geographically more expansive, are constrained by limited detail. New data in United States detailing the location and uses of retail creates a significant opportunity to develop a more complete and comprehensive overview of the national retail system, at a high spatial resolution. This research is rooted in a pragmatic effort to provide the first and most comprehensive model of U.S. retail center geographies, through development of an integrated, conceptual, and empirically grounded framework, using data from SafeGraph, to examine where they are located, what characteristics they have, and who uses them. The resulting geographies are of great interest, creating significant potential in the monitoring of the national retail system as it continues to evolve in response to wider structural challenges. Furthermore, by integrating these three geographies (where, what, and who), we establish a conceptual framework that yields substantive insights about the relationships between each of them, and argues that understandings of U.S. retail center geographies are more comprehensive and useful when considering the who, what, and where together."

    "text": "Early Career Researchers (ECRs) encounter distinctive opportunities (and challenges) within the neoliberal academy. In this commentary, we reflect on issues common to ECR experiences in quantitative human geography. Our discussion is inspired by and develops conversations from a panel at the Royal Geographical Society Institute of British Geographers (RGS-IBG) postgraduate forum, with panelists from across the subfield. Whilst many aspects of the ECR experience transcend sub-disciplinary boundaries, the quantitative subfield presents unique dynamics for ECRs to navigate. ECRs in quantitative geography are steeped in ‘data science’, which changes relations between academia and industry, with the growth of our field increasing the size and the scope of what ECRs might be expected to know and do. Bringing together reflections from the panel, we highlight the variation in pathways experienced by ECRs, reflecting on opportunities, uncertainties and mentorship, in the hope of offering insights and advice for prospective and current ECRs and their mentors."

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the ways in which we shop, with significant impacts on retail and consumption spaces. Yet, empirical evidence of these impacts, specifically at the national level, or focusing on latter periods of the pandemic remain notably absent. Using a large spatio-temporal mobility dataset, which exhibits significant temporal instability, we explore the recovery of retail centres from summer 2021 to 2022, considering in particular how these responses are determined by the functional and structural characteristics of retail centres and their regional geography. Our findings provide important empirical evidence of the multidimensionality of retail centre recovery, highlighting in particular the importance of composition, e-resilience and catchment deprivation in determining such trajectories, and identifying key retail centre functions and regions that appear to be recovering faster than others. In addition, we present a use case for mobility data that exhibits temporal stability, highlighting the benefits of viewing mobility data as a series of snapshots rather than a complete time series. It is our view that such data, when controlling for temporal stability, can provide a useful way to monitor the economic performance of retail centres over time, providing evidence that can inform policy decisions, and support interventions to both acute and longer-term issues in the retail sector."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Acknowledgements\nUndertaking a PhD amidst a global pandemic has presented significant challenges; nearly two years of mobility and travel restrictions have altered what is a ‘typical’ PhD experience. I feel that without the support of some key people, I would not have been able to successfully complete this thesis, so at this point I would like to pay tribute to some of these amazing people, and thank them for their help and support.\nFirstly, to Prof. Alex Singleton, for his continuous academic (and personal) support throughout my PhD. Over the past four years, Alex has been incredibly kind, and ensured that my skills are refined and targeted at specific projects, to ensure I could complete my studies in time, whilst listening to my own interests and giving me plenty of ownership over my project. Alex has also given me lots of encouragement and opportunities to expand my academic portfolio, network and career, going above and beyond as a PhD supervisor, dedicating significant time to issues I have had over the past four years. I really appreciate the time and effort he put into this PhD project, helping shape me into the researcher I am today, and for that I am truly grateful.\nSecondly, to my secondary supervisor Dr. Les Dolega. Les has always been on hand to offer support and advice on life in general, as well as how best to frame my research projects within the field of retail geography, often turning a paper/chapter draft around with constructive comments in a matter of days. I am particularly grateful to Les for his encouragement during my time as a Research Assistant and in the early months of my new role at Liverpool, which has given me the confidence to continue my academic journey at Liverpool as a Postdoctoral Researcher, and my interests in retail geography.\nThirdly, to my other co-authors Jacob Macdonald and Kevin Credit, as well as to the early-career panellists, Rachael Sanderson, and members of the QMRG committee, whom I worked with on a written commentary for the Geographical Journal. These people were instrumental in helping to push further publications over the line with their expertise and advice, but also gave me the opportunity to collaborate externally with other academics outside of Liverpool, which has opened a number of opportunities since, and inspired me to continue my academic journey.\nThanks to all at the CDRC, SafeGraph and Geolytix who have provided data that has been invaluable to my PhD. In particular, a big thanks to SafeGraph, who through their ‘Data for Academics’ programme made the primary objective of this PhD thesis feasible, following months of searching for useful and accessible sources of data on retailer locations for the U.S.\nI also want to thank all of my colleagues at the Geographic Data Science Lab and CDRC, who have offered me general support, advice, and friendship, reviewed drafts of papers and been there to listen when I am facing significant challenges in my research. The GDSL has been a fantastic place to do a PhD, with each and every member having an impact on my overall PhD experience. There are too many people to mention here, but I particularly wanted to acknowledge the contributions of Alessia Calafiore, Martin Fleischmann, Maurizio Gibin (CDRC), Ollie O’Brien (CDRC), May Chen (CDRC), Natalie Rose, Olivia Horsefield, Dan Owen, Sian Teesdale, James Murphy, Krasen Samardzhiev, Nikos Patias, Michael Mahony, Maya Middleton-Welch, Francisco Rowe, Dani Arribas-Bel, Mark Green, Caitlin Robinson, Jeremiah Nieves, Ron Mahabir and Olga Gkountouna, all of whom have contributed in some way to ensuring my PhD is a success.\nI also wanted to thank some of my closest friends, for their undying support over the past four years. Particular thanks to Tilly Clough, Ella Bytheway-Jackson, Libby Hopkins, John O’Neill, Jess Cerasale, Elaine Reilly and Clare Bohan, who have been there at various stages of my academic journey. Thank you to all of you for listening, discussing, supporting, and looking out for me over the past four years, and being there to celebrate my major achievements.\nA final thanks goes to Mum and Dad. As the first of the family to go to university and first to complete a PhD, I want to thank you both for your undying support and understanding over the last 8 years, especially when I was facing significant personal issues or struggling with the pressures of doing a PhD in a pandemic. Your love and care during this time has given me the opportunity to flourish in my academic career without any major concerns or stresses, and I will be eternally grateful for this, especially given the challenges you already face with Liam. Unfortunately, Dad you can’t retire just yet (haha), but I hope to one day return the favour to you both.\n\n\n\nDownload my thesis\nThe final accepted version of my PhD thesis is available to read here."

    "text": "Urban Mobility\nFollowing some research in my PhD which utilised mobility data, I have a keen interest in working closely with these types of data and using them to better understand processes of urban mobility. In particular, I am interested in asking questions such as how is urban mobility changing?, what new questions/problems can we solve with data from mobile phone applications?, how representative are these sources of data? and to what extent can we use these datasets to model observed human behaviours, like store visitation?.\n ### Accessibility and Regional Development\nBuilding on some of the freelance support work I completed for Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, I am interested in using some of the datasets and data products we have developed to generate interesting insights about accessibility within the area. In particular, I am looking to better understand the relationship between public transport accessibility and reliability; for example, you might have good access to bus stops, but to what extent are the services at those stops reliable?\n Another emerging area of interest relates to the potential use cases of high-resolution freight data we received as part of this project. I am particularly interested in looking at various ‘what if’ scenarios to do with the routing of freight through the city and its impacts on local communities. For example, what types of neighbourhoods are disproportionately affected by enhanced emissions from trucks, and how might specific economic development infrastructure (e.g., freeports) modify existing levels of localised pollution.\n\n\n\nRetail Centres and Retail Geographies\nGiven my PhD focused explicitly on the geographies of retail centres, I have a keen interest in how they continue to evolve, particularly around the use of innovative methodologies and emerging forms of data to identify such trends. Aside from this, I have a wider interest in consumer behaviour, particularly around the drivers of consumer patronage, impacts of external phenomena on sales and footfall and a wider interest in key concepts and theories in retail geography."
