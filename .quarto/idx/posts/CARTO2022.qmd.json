In particular, I delivered a workshop entitled \"Retail and Geodemographics: A Spatial Data Science Approach\" to a room full of over 100 people at Google HQ in Chelsea, NY. \n\nThe workshop introduced lots of exciting sources of Digital Footprints data, such as SafeGraphâ€™s excellent places database, and a national geodemographic classification of U.S. census tracts, based on published academic research by Alex Singleton (University of Liverpool) and Seth Spielman (Microsoft), demonstrating how we can use geodemographics to better understand the characteristics store catchments. \n\nThe conference was an excellent opportunity for me to engage with industry practitioners and large geospatial companies, expanding my network and establishing future collaboration opportunities, whilst also giving me the time to explore and enjoy everything NY has to offer.\n\n---\n\n### Photos\n\n---\n\n![](talk2.jpg)\n\n![](carto-gen.jpg)\n\n![](talk3.jpg)\n---\n\n### More Information\n\nThe workshop materials and presentation can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/patrickballantyne/CARTO-SDSC2022) created for the workshop. \n\nFor details on the rest of the Spatial Data Science Conference, check out the [full list of talks and speakers](https://spatial-data-science-conference.com/2022/newyork/#videos-on-demand). \n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"CARTO2022.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"lux","title":"CARTO Spatial Data Science Conference - October 2022","date":"2022-10-24","author":["Patrick Ballantyne"],"categories":["geographic data science","geodemographics","retail"],"subtitle":"Google HQ, Chelsea, NY","image":"goog.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
