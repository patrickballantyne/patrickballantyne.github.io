Last summer I took part in my first half marathon race in Chester, and one day hope to complete a full marathon.\n\n![](run.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Music\n\nMusic is a big part of my life. I grew up learning the fiddle and banjo, competing at international competitions or 'fleadhs' and touring the UK and Ireland in 2016 to commemorate 100 years since the Easter Rising.\n\nNow, I can usually be found over in Ireland during the summer holidays playing in sessions with my friends or going to music festivals across Ireland and the UK.\n\nAside from Irish music, I spend way too much time on Spotify. This year I was in the top 0.001% of people who listened to Coldplay (haha ikr), and am getting very excited for Eurovision here in Liverpool later next year.\n\n![](music.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Foodie\n\nI love to eat out and go out for drinks with my friends, with a particular obsession over tacos, ramen, craft beer, coffee and donuts.\n\nSome of my favourite places in Liverpool include Koffi, The Pen Factory, The Grapes, Free State Kitchen and Mother Espresso.\n\n![](profile-v3.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"lux","title":"Patrick Ballantyne - About Me","subtitle":"Research Associate / Data Scientist, Geographic Data Science"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
