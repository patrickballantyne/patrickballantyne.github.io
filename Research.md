## 1. PhD Topic

The topic of my ESRC and GEOLYITX funded MSc/PhD topic is

### *Understanding Global Retail Centres and their Composition*


I am currently in the early stages of planning this research, however some initial work has been completed:


**Aims**

1) To define a 'Global Retail Centre.'

2) To develop a framework of methods that can be used to systematically define 'Global Retail Centres'

3) To incorporate various data types and sources to run this framework, with data supplied from [GEOLYTIX](https://geolytix.co.uk/?geodata)


Some initial ideas have been developed, through meetings with supervisor(s) and GEOLYTIX

- Assessment of completed framework's applicability for the UK/USA
- Development of machine learning techniques within tensorflow to recognise shop facets
- Analysis of Barclaycard/Mastercard data to better define 'Retail Centres'

## 2. E-Resilience

Another of my research interests is on the concept of 'E-Resilience:'

**Background**

"A framework that assesses the extent to which retail centres have spatially differentiated vulnerability to the impacts of online 
  consumption" (Singleton et al., 2016)
  
The development of an 'E-Resilience' framework was funded in 2014 by the [CDRC](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/), in partnership with the 
University of Liverpool. It used census data from the 2011 census along with measures of online propensity obtained from the 
[Local Data Company](https://www.localdatacompany.com/) to develop an 'E-Resilience' figure for each LSOA of the UK.

The concept of 'E-Resilience' is such that large, attractive retail centres that people make specific journeys to, and small convenience
stores will be e-resilient, whereas mid-sized centres are likely to be more exposed to online shopping, since they occupy a less 
significant role in contemporary retail

**My Research**

As part of my individual PhD research, the Geographic Data Science lab asked me to update this framework using more up-to-date population
data, sourced from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates) for England
and Wales and from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates)
for Scotland.

The process is ongoing, but is proving to be insightful and is teaching me the basics of R in a useful manner.
